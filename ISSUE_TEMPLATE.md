<!--

This repository is moving to a new customer feedback system. See [Announcing a new way to give feedback on Microsoft Learn](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-learn-blog/announcing-a-new-way-to-give-feedback-on-microsoft-learn/ba-p/4027635).

As part of this transition, this channel will be closed in the near future for entering issues on the Visual Studio documentation. Please use the feedback mechanism at the top right of an article to report issues with that article.

For information about reporting a problem with Visual Studio, see [Report a problem](docs/ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio.md).
