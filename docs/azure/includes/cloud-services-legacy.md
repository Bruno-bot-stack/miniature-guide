> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to Azure Cloud Services (classic), which is retired as of August 31, 2024. Existing services built with this technology are still supported through [Azure Cloud Services (extended support)](../cloud-services-extended-support.md). For new development, we recommend that you use a newer service type designed for your specific purpose, such as [Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/overview), [Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-csharp), or [Azure Container Apps](/azure/container-apps/overview). For the latest list of available services, see [Directory of Azure products](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/).
