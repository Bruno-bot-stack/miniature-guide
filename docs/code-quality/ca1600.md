# CA1600: Do not use idle process priority

|-|-|
|RuleId|CA1600|
|Category|Microsoft.Mobility|

## Cause
This rule occurs when processes are set to `ProcessPriorityClass.Idle`.

## Rule description
Do not set process priority to Idle. Processes that have `System.Diagnostics.ProcessPriorityClass.Idle` will occupy the CPU when it would otherwise be idle, and will therefore block standby.

## How to fix violations
Set processes to `ProcessPriorityClass.BelowNormal`.

## When to suppress warnings
This rule should be suppressed only when Idle process priority is required and mobility considerations can be ignored safely.
