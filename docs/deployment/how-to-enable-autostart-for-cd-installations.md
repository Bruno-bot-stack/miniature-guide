# Enable AutoStart for CD installations

When deploying a ClickOnce application by means of removable media such as CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, you can enable `AutoStart` so that the ClickOnce application is automatically launched when the media is inserted.

 `AutoStart` can be enabled on the **Publish** page of the **Project Designer**.

### To enable AutoStart

1. With a project selected in **Solution Explorer**, on the **Project** menu click **Properties**.

2. Click the **Publish** tab.

   [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../deployment/includes/dotnet-publish-tool.md)]

3. Click the **Options** button.

     The **Publish Options** dialog box appears.

4. Click **Deployment**.

5. Select the **For CD installations, automatically start Setup when CD is inserted** check box.

     An *Autorun.inf* file will be copied to the publish location when the application is published.
