# Quickstart: Publish an ASP.NET web app

In this article, you'll learn how to publish your first ASP.NET web app to various locations including a local web server such as IIS and a remote cloud environment such as Azure App Service.

This article supports ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core.

## Prerequisites

You need [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads) installed with the ASP.NET and web development workload.

If you've already installed Visual Studio:

* Install the latest updates in Visual Studio by selecting **Help** > **Check for Updates**.
* Add the workload by selecting **Tools** > **Get Tools and Features**.

## Get started

In Solution Explorer, right-click your project and choose **Publish**.

If you're publishing this web app for the first time, next you see the Publish wizard.

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio filters the list of destinations depending on the type of web app.

## [Azure](#tab/azure)
## Publish your web app to Azure

For detailed steps on publishing your web app, see [Quickstart: Deploy an ASP.NET web app](/azure/app-service/quickstart-dotnetcore?tabs=netcore31&pivots=development-environment-vs#publish-your-web-app).

## [Docker](#tab/docker)
## Publish your web app to Docker Container Registry

You can publish your web app as a Docker container to any compatible Docker Container Registry.
