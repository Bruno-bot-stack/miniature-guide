# Specify an application icon (Visual Basic, C#)

The `Icon` property for a project specifies the icon file (*.ico*) that's displayed for the compiled application in **File Explorer** and in the Windows taskbar.

You can access the `Icon` property from the **Application** section of the **Project Designer**, which contains a list of icons that have been added to a project either as resources or as content files.

> [!NOTE]
> After you set the icon property for an application, you might also set the `Icon` property of each **Window** or **Form** in the application. For information about window icons for Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) standalone applications, see <xref:System.Windows.Window.Icon%2A> property.
