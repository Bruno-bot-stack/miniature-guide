# Manage project and solution properties

Projects have properties that govern many aspects of compilation, debugging, testing and deploying. Some properties are common among all project types, and some are unique to specific languages or platforms.

You access project properties by right-clicking the [project node](use-solution-explorer.md#solution-explorer-ui) in **Solution Explorer** and selecting **Properties**, or by typing **properties** into the search box on the menu bar and selecting **Properties Window** from the results.

.NET projects might also have a properties node in the project tree itself.

## Project properties

Project properties are organized into groups, and each group has its own property page. The pages might be different for different languages and project types.

### C#, Visual Basic, and F# projects

In C#, Visual Basic, and F# projects, properties are exposed in the [.NET **Project Designer**](reference/project-properties-reference.md).

The following screenshot shows the **Build** property page in the .NET Project Designer for a console project in C#:

::: moniker range="vs-2019"
:::image type="content" source="reference/media/vs-2019/project-properties-designer-build-csharp.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Project Designer, with the Build tab selected.":::
::: moniker-end

The following screenshot shows the **Compile** property page in the .NET Project Designer for a console project in Visual Basic:

::: moniker range="vs-2022"
:::image type="content" source="reference/media/vs-2022/project-properties-designer-compile-visual-basic.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Project Designer, with the Compile tab selected.":::
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="vs-2019"
:::image type="content" source="reference/media/vs-2019/project-properties-designer-compile-visual-basic.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Project Designer, with the Compile tab selected.":::
::: moniker-end

For more information about each of the **Project Designer** properties, see [What is the .NET Project Designer](reference/project-properties-reference.md).

> [!TIP]
> Solutions have a few properties, and so do project items; these properties are accessed in the [**Properties window**](reference/properties-window.md), not the [.NET Project Designer](reference/project-properties-reference.md).

### C++ and JavaScript projects

C++ and JavaScript projects have a different user interface for managing project properties. The following screenshot shows a C++ project property page (JavaScript pages are similar):

For information about C++ project properties, see [Work with project properties (C++)](/cpp/build/working-with-project-properties). For more information about JavaScript properties, see [Property pages, JavaScript](../ide/reference/property-pages-javascript.md).

## Solution properties

To access properties on the solution, right-click the [solution node](use-solution-explorer.md#solution-explorer-ui) in **Solution Explorer** and select **Properties**. In the dialog, you can set project configurations for **Debug** or **Release** builds, choose which projects should be the startup project when **F5** is pressed, and set code analysis options.

Solution properties are stored in a Solution User Options (.suo) file. For more information about this file type, see the "[**Solution file**](solutions-and-projects-in-visual-studio.md#solution-file)" section of the [Solutions and projects in Visual Studio](solutions-and-projects-in-visual-studio.md) page.
