# Display line numbers in the editor

You can show or hide line numbers in your code. Here's how.

1. On the menu bar, select **Tools** > **Options** > **Text Editor**, and then select either the language you're using or **All Languages** to turn on line numbers in all supported programming languages.

   > [!TIP]
   > You can also type **line number** in the [Search](../visual-studio-search.md) box, and then choose **Turn line numbers on or off** from the results.

2. Select the **Line numbers** checkbox to show line numbers, or clear the checkbox to hide line numbers.

> Line numbers aren't added to your code; they're just for reference.
