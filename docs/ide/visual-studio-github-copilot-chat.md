## Why use Copilot Chat in Visual Studio?

Copilot Chat provides AI assistance to help you make informed decisions and write better code. With tight integration in Visual Studio, Copilot Chat understands what you're working on and can help you with development tasks like:

- **Code explanations**: get in-depth analysis and explanation of how a code block works
- **Code help**: get answers to programming-related questions in natural language or code snippet format
- **Code refinement**: get context-specific code suggestions & recommendations
- **Unit testing**: generate unit tests
- **[Profiling](../debugger/debug-with-copilot.md#get-ai-assistance-for-auto-insights)**: optimize code performance
- **[Debugging](../debugger/debug-with-copilot.md)**: find issues and get proposed fixes to bugs and [exceptions](../debugger/debug-with-copilot.md#get-ai-assistance-for-an-exception).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need:
+ Visual Studio 2022 [version 17.8](/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-history) or later
+ Active [subscription](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/about-billing-for-github-copilot) to [GitHub Copilot for Individuals](https://docs.github.com/copilot/overview-of-github-copilot/about-github-copilot-for-individuals) or [GitHub Copilot for Business](https://docs.github.com/copilot/overview-of-github-copilot/about-github-copilot-for-business)

1. Open Visual Studio.
1. On the menu bar, select **Extensions** > **Manage Extensions**.
1. In the Search box, enter "GitHub Copilot Chat".
1. Select the **GitHub Copilot Chat** extension, and then select the **Download** button.

## Use Copilot Chat in Visual Studio

You can ask your coding related questions in natural language and GitHub Copilot Chat will answer these in your development context.

There are two places you can ask Copilot these questions; in a [chat window](#ask-questions-in-the-chat-window), or directly inline in the code that you're looking to modify, using [inline chat](#ask-questions-in-the-inline-chat-view). For questions where your goal is to modify or add to the code file you have open in the editor, the inline chat view will usually work best, whereas more general coding questions are best answered in the chat pane.

### Ask questions in the chat window

The chat window of Copilot Chat in Visual Studio enables you to ask your questions and see answers in the chat pane. It is usually the best way to work with Copilot on programming help and general coding questions.

1. In Visual Studio, select **View** > **GitHub Copilot Chat**.
1. In the Copilot Chat window, type a coding related question in the **Ask Copilot** text box. Press **Enter** or select **Send** to ask your question.
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/visual-studio-github-copilot-chat/copilot-chat-window-ask-copilot-textbox.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Copilot Chat window.":::

1. If Copilot Chat offers a code suggestion you want to use, select **Copy code block** to copy the code suggestion, **Insert in new files** to insert the code suggestion in a new file, or select **Preview** to insert the code suggestion in your current code file. Using the **Preview** button lets you preview the code in the target location so you can easily see what's being updated.

   If you ask a question for help with understanding your code, **Copy code block** and **Insert in new file** options won't be available.

    1. If you select **Preview**, you'll see the code suggestions in normal Visual Studio diff view pattern. You can review and refine what is being proposed and apply to your code by selecting **Accept** or discard by selecting **Cancel**.

    1. If you select **Insert in new file**, you'll see the code suggestions in a new file. The file is not saved by default.

### Ask questions in the inline chat view

The inline chat view of Copilot Chat in Visual Studio enables you to ask your questions and see answers inline with the code in the editor window itself. With inline chat, you don't have to go back and forth to the chat window. It is usually the best way to work with Copilot on questions that add to or update a currently open code file.

1. In Visual Studio, right click in your editor window and select **Ask Copilot** to bring up the inline chat view of Copilot Chat in the editor itself.

1. You'll see code suggestions from Copilot Chat in Visual Studio diff view. You can review and refine what is being proposed and apply to your code by selecting **Accept** or discard by selecting **Cancel**.
