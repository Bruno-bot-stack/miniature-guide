## How GitHub Copilot works

GitHub Copilot works by utilizing advanced machine learning models trained on a vast dataset of publicly available code from GitHub repositories. As you type code, the AI analyzes the context and provides relevant suggestions in real-time. You can receive suggestions also by writing a natural language comment describing what you want the code to do.

## Using GitHub Copilot for code completions and suggestions

As you type code or comments in the editor, GitHub Copilot provides context-aware code completions and suggestions. GitHub Copilot provides suggestions for numerous languages, but works especially well for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C# and C++. The following examples are in C#, but other languages will work similarly.

1. Open Visual Studio and create a new C# project.
1. Open a C# file (`Program.cs`) in the editor.
1. In the code editor, type a comment or a method signature to see inline code suggestions from GitHub Copilot.
    
   ```csharp
       // method to add two numbers
   ```

   ```csharp
       int subtractNumbers(
   ```

1. Hover over the suggestion to see the GitHub Copilot command palette. You can select **Tab** or press `Tab` to accept the suggestion or continue typing to reject it. If alternate suggestions are available, you can select **next suggestion** or use the `Alt + .` keyboard shortcut to cycle through them.
