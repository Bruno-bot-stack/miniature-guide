# Add your GitHub accounts to your Visual Studio keychain

In this article, you learn how to add your public GitHub or GitHub Enterprise account to your Visual Studio keychain. After you add your account, you'll be able to [track your code changes in GitHub repositories](../version-control/git-create-repository.md), right from Visual Studio. You can also create and use [GitHub Actions for deployment automation](../azure/azure-deployment-using-github-actions.md).

## Adding public GitHub accounts

You can add your public GitHub account at any point, even if you haven't signed into Visual Studio with a Microsoft account, work account, or school account.

**Add a GitHub account from the **Account settings** dialog:**

::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"

1. Open the Account Settings dialog by going to **File** > **Account Settings...**.

## Troubleshooting sign in issues

If you're experiencing issues when adding or re-authenticating GitHub accounts, try the following steps:

Verify that HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is not enabled for localhost on your system's default web browser:
- On Microsoft Edge, you can type: edge://net-internals/#hsts and enter _localhost_ under the **Delete domain security policies** section.
- On Google Chrome, type: chrome://net-internals/#hsts and enter _localhost_ under the **Delete domain security policies** section.

> [!NOTE]
> Please [report a problem](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/report?space=8&entry=problem) if you're still experiencing sign in issues.
