# Create a Git repository from Visual Studio

Visual Studio makes it easy to create a repo right from the IDE. Repository creation from Visual Studio is optimized for GitHub, but you can work remotely with the Git provider of your choice.  Here's how.

## Prerequisites

To follow this article, you'll need:
+ [Visual Studio installed](../install/install-visual-studio.md)
+ [A GitHub user account](git-create-github-account.md)

## Create a GitHub repo

1. Open Visual Studio, and then select **Create a new project**.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you don't already have a project in Visual Studio to add to a repo, you can quickly [create a new C# console app](../get-started/csharp/tutorial-console.md#create-a-project) and name it **MyNewApp**. Visual Studio populates your new app with default "*Hello, World!*" code.

1. From the **Git** menu, select **Create Git Repository**.

1. In the **Create a Git repository** dialog, under the **Push to a new remote** section, choose **GitHub**.

1. In the **Create a new GitHub repository** section of the **Create a Git repository** dialog, enter the name of the repo you want to create. (If you haven't yet signed in to your GitHub account, you can do so from this screen, too.)

    Under **Initialize a local Git Repository**, you can use the **.gitignore template** option to specify any intentionally untracked files that you want Git to ignore. To learn more about .gitignore, see [Ignoring files](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files). And to learn more about licensing, see [Licensing a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository).

    > [!TIP]
    > You can update and change these settings whenever you want to. For detailed instructions, see [Git settings in Visual Studio](git-settings.md).

1. After you sign in and enter your repo info, select the **Create and Push** button to create your repo and add your app.

### Open an existing local repository

After youâ€™ve created a repo or [cloned one](git-clone-repository.md), Visual Studio detects the Git repository and adds it to your list of **Local Repositories** in the Git menu. From there, you can quickly access and switch between your Git repositories.

## Create an Azure DevOps repo

1. Open Visual Studio, and then select **Create a new project**.

1. From the **Git** menu, select **Create Git Repository**.

1. In the **Create a Git repository** dialog, under the **Push to a new remote** section, choose **Azure DevOps**.

1. In the **Create a new Azure DevOps repository** section, sign in to your Azure account, and then select a project from the **Project** drop-down list.

1. Select the **Create and Push** button to create your repo and add your app.
