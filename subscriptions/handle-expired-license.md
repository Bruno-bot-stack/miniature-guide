# Expired subscriptions

When a userâ€™s subscription has expired, a red bar appears next to their name in the list of subscribers. For those subscribers to continue using their Visual Studio subscription benefits, you need to renew their licenses.

## Renew subscriptions

1. Contact your Volume Licensing reseller or your Microsoft seller.
2. Provide them with your Agreement Number and Purchase Account Number. 

Your reseller or Microsoft seller will guide you through the process of renewing or purchasing more subscriptions. After the order has been placed or the contract has been renewed, the new subscriptions will be available and can be [assigned to your subscribers](assign-license.md).
