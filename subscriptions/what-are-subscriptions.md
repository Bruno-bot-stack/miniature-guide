## How can I purchase a subscription? 
Subscriptions are available through several channels.  
+ Volume licensing.  For larger organizations would need multiple subscriptions, volume licensing provides a cost-effective way to purchase what they need. Volume license purchases frequently use multi-year agreements.  Learn more about [licensing programs.](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/licensing-programs/licensing-programs?rtc=1)

Monthly subscriptions can be purchased on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) or through a [Cloud Solution Provider.](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partner-dir)
